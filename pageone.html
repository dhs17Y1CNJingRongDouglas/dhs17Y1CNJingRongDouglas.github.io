<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them draws on Harry Potter's rich mythology to deliver a spinoff that dazzles with franchise-building magic all its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immersing yourself in JK Rowling's magical universe is always entertaining, but fans should know that this exploration of America's wizarding world is definitely a more grown-up movie.As promised, the title critters in Fantastic Beasts are whimsically entertaining and occasionally as entrancing as those animals crawling through a medieval illuminated manuscript."Fantastic Beasts" does double-duty as yet another imagination-tickling fantasy adventure and a deeply troubled commentary on tolerance, fear, and bigotry in the world today.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid Harry Potter series movie but often prioritizes setup over memorable drama or spellbinding action.</span></p>
