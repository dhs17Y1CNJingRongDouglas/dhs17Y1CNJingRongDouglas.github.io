<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director Zack Snyder&rsquo;s sporadically impressive 2013 Superman reboot Man of Steel flirted with some intriguingly adventurous ideas before descending into a thunderingly dull third-act punch-up between all-but indestructible &ndash; and indistinguishably uninteresting &ndash; adverseries. Little has changed with this latest instalment, which sees DC Comics characters gearing up for future &ldquo;Justice League&rdquo; outings, hoping to give Marvel&rsquo;s saleable screen universe a run for its money.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assorted Avengers need not worry; despite a slow-burn start and portent-heavy script (endless references to false gods and monsters) Batman v Superman never flies. Ben Affleck may make a strong fist of his role as the screen&rsquo;s grouchiest Batman but Snyder (who is no Christopher Nolan) mistakes &ldquo;murkiness&rdquo; for &ldquo;darkness&rdquo;, leaving his stodgy antiheroes stomping around in a Stygian quagmire of quasi-religious imagery, superficial set pieces, and &ndash; most damagingly &ndash; incoherent storytelling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We open on familiar ground with the young Bruce Wayne being orphaned yet again, this time in the shadow of a movie theatre pointedly playing Excalibur. From here, we cut (after a pop video-style vision of bats) to Metropolis, where the collateral damage of Man of Steel&rsquo;s climactic battle is replayed from the point of view of the adult Bruce, watching in horror as his own tower tumbles. Then we&rsquo;re off again, to &ldquo;Somewhere in the Indian Ocean&rdquo; and thence to Africa, where Lois Lane (Amy Adams) awaits rescue by a man in wet-look spandex. &ldquo;He answers to no one, I think, not even to God,&rdquo; declares one naysayer of Henry Cavill&rsquo;s supremely uncharismatic Superman.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile Batman&rsquo;s habit of branding villains with the &ldquo;mark of death&rdquo; earns him a reputation as unaccountable judge, jury and executioner. Two crusaders (&ldquo;black and blue, night and day&rdquo;) with matching PR problems and mirrored mummy issues &ndash; it&rsquo;s bound to end in tears.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Jesse Eisenberg&rsquo;s upstart Lex Luthor, surely the most irritating screen villain of the year, a twitchy symphony of babbled lines and out-of-context laughs which suggest that Snyder told him to &ldquo;Do that guy out of The Social Network&hellip; only more so!&rdquo; Luthor wants Holly Hunter&rsquo;s Senator Finch to let him weaponise kryptonite; I just wanted her to slap him and be done with it. But there&rsquo;s much cross-cutting, cape-flapping and pouty breast-beating to come before anyone heads for the exit, reminding us that with great power </span></p>
